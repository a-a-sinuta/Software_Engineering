Advances in medicine and improvements in care have led to longer life expectancies, resulting in an aging population and increased pressure
on the healthcare system. The field of end-of-life care is facing new challenges as the number of people living to older ages and the complexity
of chronic and debilitating diseases continue to rise at a rapid pace. According to the recent OECD report Time for Better Care at the End of Life,
close to 7 million people needed end-of-life care in the OECD countries prior to the Covid-19 Pandemic and over 10 million people will need end-of-life
care by 2050. A valuable approach to identify and understand gaps in high-quality, person-centered support for individuals nearing the end of their lives
is to measure and investigate regional and provider variation.
We invite researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to submit their contributions to our Call for Papers on the topic of Regional
and Provider Variation in End-of-life Care. For this collection, we take the OECD approach to end-of-life-care, which understands it as the care provided
to people who are in the last 12 months of life, including the terminal stage of palliative care. This interdisciplinary inquiry aims to explore various
aspects related to the provision, accessibility, and quality of care in different geographical regions.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
• Palliative care : Enhancing understanding and implementation of palliative care, including pain management, symptom control, psychosocial
support, spiritual care, and the integration of palliative care into various healthcare settings.
• Morbidity-related challenges: Examining the challenges and complexities associated with providing end-of-life care for individuals with
 specific or multiple chronic conditions and the challenges of providing care across specialties
